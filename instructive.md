I would like to add some pay features to the app, I Will tell You which features they are and also You should plan something to set up the payments as I don't hace anything set up, the features Will be the following on the document

- I would like the user to have the possibility to choose on what part of the routine he Will start, maybe the user wants to skip some part of the routine, like starting from the second repetition of a block (skipping the first repetition) or starting from another block, what would be the best way for You to implement that having a great UI/UX and being pretty intuitive?
- I would also like the possibility of the user to choose sustitute exercises, like go to the exercise list and choose which sustitutes it could have, and when being on the routine it could have a small floating button at the right side to replace the exercise for the next sustitute on the list, and if there is more than one, the sustitute that appeared has the same button and after pressing the button the next sustitute on the list appears, is for order.
